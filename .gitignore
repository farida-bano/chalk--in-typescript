"SLOVING"
It seems like you're encountering a permission issue while trying to install the inquirer package using npm.
This could be due to insufficient permissions to create directories in your npm cache directory.

a)To resolve this, you can try the following steps:

Run the command with elevated privileges:
sudo npm install --save inquirer
b)If you don't want to use sudo, you can change the ownership of the npm cache directory to your user:
sudo chown -R$(whoami) ~/.npm
If you're still facing issues, you can try clearing npm's cache and then installing the package again:
npm cache clean --force
npm install --save inquire
These steps should help you resolve the permission issue and install the inquirer package successfully.
